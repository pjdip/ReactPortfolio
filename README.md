## Installation

The only thing you will need to have installed in order to run the index.html file is a functioning web browser. It should work with most versions of most browswers. I recommend the Brave browser, as you will be paid in the Basic Attention Token (BAT) for viewing ads, instead of being bombarded with ads and getting nothing for it.

## Usage 

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

Here are a few images of the page (notice the navbar indicating which section you are currently in):
